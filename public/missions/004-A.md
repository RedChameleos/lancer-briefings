# Mission // #004
## Last Castle

Brava Hadura outlines the situation: At best, the
colony has abandoned the refugees outside the
walls. At worst, it views them not simply as a liability,
but as an active and growing threat to security. She is
unable to act directly in her capacity as militia
commander, but with the broad emergency powers
granted to the PCs by Patience and their status as
freelancers, they can certainly assist. She asks the
PCs to aid the refugees in whatever way they can. In
return, she promises to requisition licenses and
resources for them, along with anything else she can
slide under the table.

# Goals
- Aid the refugee camp outside ofEvergreen in any ways possible.

# Stakes
- Without aid or anyone to advocate for them, the refugees will be slaughtered or captured when the Machine arrives at the city.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
